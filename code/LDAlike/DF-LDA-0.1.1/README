DIRICHLET FOREST TOPIC MODELING (DF-LDA)
Version 0.1.1

This software implements the Dirichlet Forest (DF) Prior [1] within
the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for discrete count data.
When combined with LDA [2], the Dirichlet Forest Prior allows the user
to encode domain knowledge into the prior on topic-word
multinomials. The inference method is Collapsed Gibbs sampling [3].
This code can also be used to do "standard" LDA by applying no domain
knowledge, or setting the "strength" parameter eta to 1, equivalent to
[3].

MCMC inference is implemented within a Python C++ extension module.


BUILD/INSTALL

Building this module requires installation of Python and NumPy, as
well as a C++ compiler.  From the command-line, do:

% python setup.py install

(Note that if NumPy or Python are installed to non-standard locations,
you may need to make the appropriate changes in setup.py)

You can then test the installation with:

% python test/testPrefGraph.py -v
% python test/testDF.py -v

There is also a simple example scipt showing how to use the software:

% cd example
% python example.py


LOCAL INSTALL

If you do not have write access to your Python installation directories,
you will need to tell setup.py to install this module somewhere else.
For example:

% python setup.py install --prefix=~/local

will install the module under a subdirectory of your home directory called 
"local".

It may then be necessary to let Python know where that is by setting
the PYTHONPATH environment variable (e.g., in .bashrc or .cshrc).  For
our example this might involve adding something like the line:

setenv PYTHONPATH ~/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages


HOW TO USE

The commenting in the example/example.py script explains the meanings and
types of all input and return arguments.  For more detailed examples
of good/bad inputs, you can examine the tests in test/testDF.py.
