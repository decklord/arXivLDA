what

there
other

give
him

familiar
his

out
clause
will
into

brief

after

could
not

any

jet
hiring
him
perhap
explain
why
week
parcell
declared
would
not
stand

belichick
getting
head
coaching
job
belichick
reportedly
turned
down
even
considering
similar
opportunities
oakland

last

part
because
contract
guarantees
will
replace

when

could
use
his

arguably
leading
available

bring
his
own
people
both

belichick
alway

kraft
remain
key
survival
any
head

bledsoe
often
praised
him
during

been
trying

way
beat
his

just
important
belichick
reportedly
learned
his
public
relation
gaffes
cleveland
mistakes
ultimately
doomed
him
more
than
anything

there
one
problem
there
because
